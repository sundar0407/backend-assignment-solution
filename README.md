# Backend Developer Assignment Solution

## Project Description

This repository contains the solutions for the backend developer assignment. The primary task was to solve four mathematical problems 
(two trigonometry and two compound interest) and present their solutions by populating two distinct front-end HTML templates.

The project strictly adheres to the assignment's core constraint: to only modify the content (numbers, variables, and text) within 
the provided templates, without altering their original HTML structure, layout, or CSS.

## Live Solutions

The final rendered HTML pages for each solved problem are hosted on GitHub Pages. You can view them directly using the links below. 
The first trigonometry solution serves as the main index page for the site.
